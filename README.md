Impress My Date 

## Inspiration

Planning a great date is stressful, with too many choices and not enough personalization. We wanted to make dating feel effortless, romantic, and memorable by combining AI, local restaurants, and digital keepsakes.

## What it does

**Impress My Date** uses GPS to auto-detect your location and starts a natural conversation (text or voice) to plan the perfect date by:

- Finding nearby spots using Yelp AI API (Search & Chat) 
- Showing restaurant details with a direct Yelp page link, along with estimated costs  
- Suggesting before-and-after date spots (coffee, walks, bars, desserts) with a time-based date schedule  
- Respects dietary restrictions, budget, and date style (romantic, adventurous, casual, etc.)  
- Saves your favorite date memories and mints them as NFTs 

## How we built it

We built a conversational AI experience powered by **Yelp AI API (Search & Chat)**, GPS location services,  **Polkadot blockchain NFT's**, and **ElevenLabs AI text to speech** (example - https://vimeo.com/1147171771?share=copy&fl=sv&fe=ci). User preferences are stored in profiles, while memorable dates are minted as NFTs for permanent ownership.

## Challenges we ran into

- Balancing detailed planning without overwhelming the user  
- Making the AI's conversations feel natural
- Accurately estimating costs and timing across multiple venues  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- A truly conversational, voice-enabled date planner  
- End-to-end date experiences, not just restaurant suggestions  
- Seamless integration of real-world moments with blockchain memories  
- Personalized planning that adapts to the user's style, budget, and location  

## What we learned

There's inherent value to simplicity over endless options. Romance is about timing, flow, and context, not just the venue. After all, NFTs are most powerful when tied to our real emotional moments. 

## What's next for Impress My Date

The future we see for **Impress My Date** is: couple profiles and shared date histories, AI-generated date recaps, social sharing and collaborative planning in more cities with real-time availability.
